                <span class="first-paragraph">Russian-born Telegram boss Pavel Durov was released on bail
                after being placed un<wbr>der formal investigation by French authoriti<wbr>es following
                his arrest as part of a probe rela<wbr>ted to illegal
                content carried on his messaging app.</span>
                <br><br>
                Durov was freed after paying a €5 million deposit and instructed not to leave France.
                The Kremlin, which is closely watching the case, emphasised his status as a Russian
                citizen and warned against <q>political persecution</q>.
                Russian-born Durov, dressed in black and wearing dark glasses, walked briskly
                out of the Paris court house late Wednesday into a waiting car after being charged
                out but allowed to go free under judicial supervision.
                <br><br>
                Durov, 39, was charged on several counts of failing to curb extremist and illegal
                content on the popular messaging app which now has over 900 million followers but
                has become increasingly controversial.
                His lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said it was <q>absurd</q> to suggest Durov could be
                implicated in any crime committed on the app, adding: <q>Telegram complies in all
                respects with European rules concerning digital technology.</q>
                <br><br>
                In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned France against turning the case
                into <q>political persecution</q>, emphasising he is a <q>Russian citizen</q> and
                <q>we will be watching what happens next.</q>
                Among those also voicing support for Durov is fellow tech tycoon and chief
                executive of X, Elon Musk, who has posted comments under the hashtag #FreePavel.<br><br>

                <p class="election-text">
                    Musk, the world’s richest man, has called for drastic reductions in government spending, although he
                    has provided few specifics about where he would direct cuts.

                    During Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the federal
                    budget could be slashed by “at least” $2 trillion.

                    “Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that,” Musk
                    told Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald and a member of Trump’s
                    transition planning team, when asked how much he could “rip out” of the latest federal budget.

                    “We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.”

                    Such a reduction in spending – equal to nearly one-third of last year’s federal budget of $6.75 trillion
                    – would almost certainly be impossible to achieve without steep cuts in areas that politicians across the
                    aisle have been loath to touch, including social security, healthcare, veterans’ benefits, and defence.

                    Musk himself has acknowledged that such a sharp cut in spending would inflict serious economic pain.

                    On Tuesday, he responded “sounds about right” to a post on X that predicted there would be “an initial
                    severe overreaction in the economy” and “markets will tumble.”

                    SpaceX and Tesla did not respond to requests seeking comment from Musk.
